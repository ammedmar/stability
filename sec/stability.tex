Given any cohomology operation $\theta \in \cO(\kk, n; \kk, m)$, we establish that the interleaving distance $\di$ between the $\theta$-barcodes of two $\R$-spaces $X$ and $Y$ is bounded above by the homotopy interleaving distance $\dhi$ between $X$ and $Y$ (see Definition \ref{def:dhi}).
%Furthermore, when the $\R$-diagrams are given by the Vietoris--Rips filtrations of two metric spaces, this upper bound can be replaced with twice the Gromov--Hausdorff distance $\dgh$ between the metric spaces. See Theorem \ref{thm:theta stability} for details.

% Let $X$ be a q-tame $\R$-diagram of spaces.
% Recall from \textsection \ref{subsubsec:theta-barcodes} that any cohomology operation $\theta \in \cO(\kk,n; \kk,m)$ defines a morphism of persistence modules $\theta \colon \rH^n(X; \k) \to \rH^m(X; \k)$ for any $\R$-diagram of spaces.

\lemma Given two $\R$-diagrams of spaces $X$ and $Y$, we have
\[
\di(\thetamodule{X}, \thetamodule{Y}) \leq \di(X,Y).
\]

\begin{proof}
	This follows directly from the fact that $X \mapsto \thetamodule{X}$ defines a functor from the category of spaces to the category of vector spaces over $\k$.
	\anibal{I think more should be said.}

\theorem Given two $\R$-diagrams of spaces $X$ and $Y$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:theta di-stability}
	\di(\thetamodule{X}, \thetamodule{Y})\leq \dhi(X,Y)
\end{equation}

\begin{proof}
	Let $X$ and $Y$ be $\R$-diagrams of spaces. 
	Take any $\delta > \dhi(X,Y)$.
	By the definition of the homotopy interleaving distance, there exist $\R$-diagrams of spaces $X' \simeq X$ and $Y' \simeq Y$ such that $X'$ and $Y'$ are $\delta$-interleaved.
	By applying the triangle inequality, Lemma \ref{lem:di stability} and Lemma \ref{lem:w.h.e. preservance}, we obtain
	\begin{align*}
		\di(\thetamodule{X}, \thetamodule{Y}) \leq& \,
		\di(\thetamodule{X}, \thetamodule{X'}) + \di(\thetamodule{X'}, \thetamodule{Y'}) + \di(\thetamodule{Y'}, \thetamodule{Y}) \\ =& \, 
		0 + \di(\thetamodule{X'}, \thetamodule{Y'}) + 0 \\ \leq \,&
		\di(X',Y') \\ \leq \,&
		\delta.
	\end{align*}
	Since $\delta > \dhi(X,Y)$ is arbitrary, we obtain the desired inequality given in Equation (\ref{eq:theta di-stability}).
\end{proof}

\corollary
In the case of the Vietoris--Rips filtration of compact metric spaces $\cX$ and $\cY$, we have
\ling{should we write '$\img$' in the notation of $\theta$-barcodes and $Sq$-barcodes?}
\[
\db(\thetabarc{\cX}, \thetabarc{\cY}) \leq 2 \cdot \dgh(X,Y)
\]

\ling{notation conflict: $X,Y$ are used both for metric spaces and diagrams of spaces. I will use $X$ and $Y$ in this file and we can change them later.}

In the case of the Vietoris--Rips filtration of compact metric spaces $\cX$ and $\cY$, first note that the persistence modules $\thetamodule{\cX}$ and $\thetamodule{\cY}$ are q-tame.
Thus,
\[
\db\big(\thetabarc{\cX}, \thetabarc{\cY}\big) =
\di(\thetamodule{\cX}, \thetamodule{\cY}).
\]
%$\di$ between these two persistence modules agree with the bottleneck distance $\db$ between their corresponding barcodes.
Combining Equation (\ref{eq:theta di-stability}) with Theorem \ref{thm:stability-HI} the stability of $\dhi$, we have
\[
\di(\thetamodule{X}, \thetamodule{Y}) \leq
\dhi(X,Y)\leq 2\cdot \dgh(X,Y).
\]
Therefore, the bottleneck distance $\db$ between the $\theta$-barcodes is also bounded above by $2\cdot \dgh(X,Y)$.
