\section{Background}

\subsection{Persistence theory}

Let $\sR$ denote the category of real numbers and $\Vec_\bullet$ that of $\Z$-graded finite dimensional vector spaces over a fixed field $\k$, that is, collections $V = \set{V_n}_{n\in\Z}$ of such vector spaces as objects with collections $f = \set{f_n}_{n\in\Z}$ of linear maps as morphisms.
The category of graded persistence modules $\Vec_\bullet^\sR$ is the functor category $\Fun(\sR, \Vec_\bullet)$.

\subsection{Barcodes}

We use open intervals to represent bars in the barcode of a persistence module. We say a bar $(b,d)$ is \textbf{dominated by} another bar $(b',d')$ if $b\geq b'$ and $d\leq d'$, or equivalently if $(b,d)$ is contained in $(b',d')$.
