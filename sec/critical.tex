\subsection{First critical values}\label{sub:general_barcodes}

%Let $X$ be an $\R$-space where $X_r$ is empty for $r<0$ and contractible for $r\geq R$ for some real number $R$.
%The Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric space is our primary example.
%In this subsection, we will consider this $\R$-space and omit it from the notation when convenient.

\subsubsection{}\label{subsub:first_critical_value}\label{subsub:beta v.s. fillrad}

Let \(\cX\) be a metric space.
%Let $X$ be an $\R$-space where $X_r$ is empty for $r \leq 0$ and contractible for $r \geq R$ for some real number $R$.
%The Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric space is our primary example.
%The \defn{first critical value} of the $\R$-space $X$ is the supremum among real numbers $r$ such that $X_{s,t}$ is a homotopy equivalence for any $s,t \in [0,r]$. \ling{change throughtout the paper that the filtration is open Vietoris-Rips.}
The \defn{first critical value} of \(\cX\), denoted \(\crit(\cX)\), is the supremum among real numbers $r$ such that $\VR_{s,t}(\cX)$ is a homotopy equivalence for any $s,t \in [0,r]$. \ling{change throughout the paper that the filtration is open Vietoris-Rips.}

Let us fix a field which we suppress from the notation.
For any \(m \in \N\), .... \anibal{define \(\crit_m(\cX)\) just as before using reduced homology. Do not use bars, since we are not assuming it is q-tame}

Similarly, consider \(\theta \in \cO(\ell, m)\), \anibal{define \(\crit_\theta(\cX)\) as before}

%The \defn{first critical value} of a persistence module which is \(0\) for negative numbers, is defined as the smallest value \(\beta\) such that \((0, \beta)\) appears as a bar in the barcode of the persistence module.\anibal{Careful with the open vs closed interval here}
%
%\ling{use reduced homology.}

Clearly, \(\crit(\cX)\) is bounded above by \(\crit_m(\cX)\) and \(\crit_\theta(\cX)\).
In addition, all of these are bounded above by $R$.\anibal{Use this notation instead of \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\)} \anibal{What is \(R\) in terms of \(\cX\)?}

\subsubsection{}\label{l:crit_val and fill_rad 1}

\lemma For a connected closed $n$-manifold $\cM$ we have
%If \(\beta_n\) denotes the first critical value of \(\rH_n(\VR(\cX); \k)\) then
\[
\crit_m(\cM) \leq 2 \cdot \fillrad(\cM).
\]

\begin{proof}
	This follows directly from the lemma in \cref{ss:filling_radius}. \anibal{Improve please}
\end{proof}

%\medskip Recall from \cref{ss:filling_radius} that $\VR_{2\bullet}(\cX)$ and the Kuratowski filtration $U_\bullet(\cX)$ are (filtered) homotopy equivalent.
%By the definition of the filling radius, it follows that the first critical value of the $n^\th$ homology of $\VR(\cX)$ is at most $2\fillradnofield{\cX}$.

\subsubsection{}\label{subsub:barcode_general}

Let $X$ be an $\R$-space as before.
Let \(\degp \in \N\) and \(\theta \in \cO(\ell,\degp)\) a linear cohomology operation.
We respectively denote by $\alpha, \beta_\degp$ and $\gamma_\theta$ the first critical values of $X$, \(\rH_\degp(X)\), and \(\img_\theta(X)\).\anibal{It should be \(\gamma_\theta\) not \(\gamma_\degp\).
	Additionally, We should talk about \(\img_\theta\)-barcodes not \(\theta\)-barcodes since this analysis is not been carried through for \(\ker_\theta\). Or is it?}
 \ling{Follow this convention and unify notation.}

Because the $\R$-space $X$ is empty for \(r < 0\) and the homotopy type of $X_r$ remains unchanged for $r \in [0, \alpha)$, bars in \(\barc \rH_\degp(X)\) and $\barc\img_\theta(X)$ either start at $0$ or start after $\alpha$.

%In addition, for degrees $\degp$ such that $\rH_\degp(X_0)$ is non-trivial, the barcode of the $\degp^\th$ homology of $X$ always contains $(0,\beta_\degp)$.
%More precisely,
Furthermore, if \(k = \dim \opH_\degp(X_0) > 0\) then the $\barc\rH_\degp X$ contains $(0,\beta_m)$ and \((k - 1)\) additional bars of the form \((0, a)\) for \(a \in [\beta_\degp, R]\), along with possibly more bars dominated by \((\alpha, \pi)\).
