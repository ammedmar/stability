\anibal{Ling's question: Can something be born before something dies in the $\VR$ homology}
%Let $X$ be an $\R$-space where $X_r$ is empty for $r<0$ and contractible for $r\geq R$ for some real number $R$.
%The Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric space is our primary example.
%In this subsection, we will consider this $\R$-space and omit it from the notation when convenient.

\subsubsection{}\label{subsub:first_critical_value}\label{subsub:beta v.s. fillrad}

Let \(\cM\) be a closed Riemannian manifold.
By \cite[Thm.3.5]{hausmann1995vietoris}, we know that there is a \(r(\cM) > 0\) such that for all \(r \in (0,r(\cM))\) the spaces \(\VR_r(\cM)\) and \(\cM\) are homotopy equivalent.
We define the \defn{first critical \(\VR\)-value} of \(\cM\), denoted by \(\crit(\cM)\), as the supremum among all such real numbers.

Let \(\cM\) be connected.
Since, as stated in \cref{ss:kuratowski}, \(\VR_{2r}(\cM)\) is homotopy equivalent to \(U_r(\cM) \subset \rL^\infty(\cM)\), an upper bound for \(\crit(\cM)\) is \(2\cdot\fillrad(\cM)\).
We generalize this from the top homology to every other degree \(\degp\).
Let \(\fillrad_m(\cM)\) be the smallest positive radius $r$ for which a reduced homology class in \(\cH_\degp(\cM)\) becomes \(0\) in \(U_r(\cM)\) and $\infty$ if $\rH_m(\cM) = 0$. \ling{I think the notation $\fillrad$ is too `heavy' (mathematically). It is a quantity we `create' to describe the barcode estimates. It might have deeper meanings, but we are not presenting those.}
Clearly
\[
\crit(\cM) \leq 2 \cdot \fillrad_m(\cM)
\]
and, if \(\cM\) is connected and \(n\)-dimensional,
\[
\fillrad_n(\cM) = \fillrad(\cM).
\]

Similarly, consider \(\theta \in \cO(\ell, m)\), \anibal{continue here}

\subsubsection{}\label{l:crit_val and fill_rad 1}

\lemma For a closed connected $n$-manifold $\cM$, we have
\[
\crit_n(\cM) = 2 \cdot \fillrad(\cM).
\]

\begin{proof}
	This follows from the lemma in \cref{ss:filling_radius}, which states that \((0,2\fillradnofield{\cM})\) is the unique interval in \(\Hbarc{n}{\cM}\) starting at $0$.
\end{proof}

%\medskip Recall from \cref{ss:filling_radius} that $\VR_{2\bullet}(\cX)$ and the Kuratowski filtration $U_\bullet(\cX)$ are (filtered) homotopy equivalent.
%By the definition of the filling radius, it follows that the first critical value of the $n^\th$ homology of $\VR(\cX)$ is at most $2\fillradnofield{\cX}$.

\subsubsection{}\label{subsub:barcode_general}

Let $X$ be an $\R$-space as before.
Let \(\degp \in \N\) and \(\theta \in \cO(\ell,\degp)\) a linear cohomology operation with $\ell \neq m$.
\anibal{It should be \(\gamma_\theta\) not \(\gamma_\degp\).
	Additionally, We should talk about \(\img_\theta\)-barcodes not \(\theta\)-barcodes since this analysis is not been carried through for \(\ker_\theta\). Or is it?}
 \ling{Follow this convention and unify notation.}

Because the $\R$-space $X$ is empty for \(r \leq 0\) and the homotopy type of $X_r$ remains unchanged for $r \in (0, \crit(X))$, bars in \(\barc \rH_\degp(X)\) and $\barc\img_\theta(X)$ either start at $0$ or start after $\crit(X)$.

Furthermore, we estimate the reduced homology barcode by considering two cases.
If \(k = \dim \opH_\degp(X_0) > 0\) then the $\barc\rH_\degp X$ contains $(0,\firstdeath{m}{X})$ and \((k - 1)\) additional bars of the form \((0, a)\) for \(a \in [\firstdeath{m}{X}, R]\), along with possibly more bars dominated by \((\crit(X), \pi)\).
If $\dim \opH_\degp(X_0) = 0$, then all bars in $\barc\rH_\degp X$ are dominated by \((\crit(X), \pi)\).
See the first row of \cref{fig:barcodes_general} for the barcode estimates of the reduced homology.

A similar analysis applies to $\barc\img_\theta(X)$.
% Similarly, if \(k = \dim \img \theta_{X_0} > 0\) then the $\barc\img_\theta(X)$ contains $(0,\crit_\theta(X))$ and \((k - 1)\) additional bars of the form \((0, a)\) for \(a \in [\crit_\theta(X), R]\), along with possibly more bars dominated by \((\crit(X), \pi)\).
% If $\dim \img \theta_{X_0} = 0$, then all bars in $\barc\img_\theta(X)$ are dominated by \((\crit(X), \pi)\).
See the second row of \cref{fig:barcodes_general} for the estimates of the $\img_\theta$-barcodes.
