%Let $X$ be an $\R$-space where $X_r$ is empty for $r<0$ and contractible for $r\geq R$ for some real number $R$.
%The Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric space is our primary example.
%In this subsection, we will consider this $\R$-space and omit it from the notation when convenient.

\subsection{Kuratowski embedding and the filling radii}\label{sub:filling radii}

\subsubsection{}\label{ss:kuratowski}

Any compact metric space $\cX$ can be isometrically embedded into the space $\rL^\infty(\cX)$ of all bounded real-valued functions on $\cX$ via the map $x \in \cX \mapsto d_\cX(x,\cdot)$.
%where $d_\cX(x,\cdot)$ is the distance function to $x$.
As proven in \cite[Theorem.4.1]{lim2020vietoris}, there is deep relationship between the \(r\)-neighborhood filtration of $\cX$ in $\rL^\infty(\cX)$ and the Vietoris--Rips complex of \(\cX\) at distance \(2r\), stated in the following.

\medskip\lemma The spaces $\VR_{2r}(\cX)$ and $U_r(\cX)$ are naturally homotopy equivalent for every \(r > 0\).

\subsubsection{}\label{ss:filling_radius}

We will consider Riemannian manifolds as metric spaces by equipping them the geodesic distance.
Following \cite{gromov1983filling}, the \defn{filling radius} of a closed orientable Riemannian $n$-manifold $\cM$ is defined as the infimal $\epsilon > 0$ such that the fundamental class in $\rH_n(M; \Z)$ is mapped to zero by the inclusion $\cM \hookrightarrow U_\epsilon(\cM)$.
For non-orientable manifolds, the filling radius is defined similarly using \(\Ftwo\) coefficients.
The previous natural homotopy equivalence gives rise to the following result proven in \cite[Prop.9.28]{lim2020vietoris}.

\medskip\lemma
If $\cM$ is a closed connected $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, then \(\Hbarc{n}{\cM}\) contains the bar \((0,2\fillradnofield{\cM})\) for arbitrary field coefficients if $M$ is orientable, and for mod $2$ coefficients $M$ if not.
Moreover, this is the unique bar in \(\Hbarc{n}{\cM}\) starting at $0$.

\subsubsection{}\label{ss:first_critical_value}

Let \(\cM\) be a closed Riemannian manifold.
By \cite[Thm.3.5]{hausmann1995vietoris}, we know that there is a \(r(\cM) > 0\) such that for all \(r \in (0,r(\cM))\) the spaces \(\VR_r(\cM)\) and \(\cM\) are homotopy equivalent.
We define the \defn{first critical \(\VR\)-value} of \(\cM\), denoted by \(\crit(\cM)\), as the supremum among all such real numbers.

%\ling{Just a warning that we restrict ourselves to only talking about the critical values of manifolds. This seems fine. The only non-manifold spaces we are studying are wedge sums of spheres, whose barcodes are obtained by taking unions of barcodes of spheres.}

\subsubsection{}
\label{subsub:beta v.s. fillrad}

Let us assume \(\cM\) connected.
Since, as stated in \cref{ss:kuratowski}, \(\VR_{2r}(\cM)\) is homotopy equivalent to \(U_r(\cM) \subset \rL^\infty(\cM)\), an upper bound for \(\crit(\cM)\) is \(2\cdot\fillrad(\cM)\).
We generalize this from the top homology to every other degree \(\degp\) and to non-connected manifolds so that
\[
\fillrad_\degp(\cM) = \fillrad(\cM)
\]
if \(\cM\) connected and \(\degp\)-dimensional.

If \(\rH_\degp(\cM) = 0\), set \(\fillrad_m(\cM) = 0\), and if not, let \(\fillrad_m(\cM)\) be the smallest positive radius $r$ for which a non-zero homology class in \(\rH_\degp(\cM)\) becomes \(0\) in \(U_r(\cM)\).
Since \(\VR(\cM)\) is \(q\)-tame,
\[
\fillrad_m(\cM) = \min\set[\big]{r \mid (0, 2r) \in \barc \rH^{\VR}_m(\cM)}.
\]
Clearly, if \(\rH_m(\cM) \neq 0\),
\[
\crit(\cM) \leq 2 \cdot \fillrad_m(\cM).
\]
Similarly, for a linear cohomology operation \(\theta\), we define
\[
\fillrad_\theta(\cM) = \min\set[\big]{r \mid (0, 2r) \in \barc \img_\theta^{\!\VR}(\cM)}
\]
and observe that
\[
\crit(\cM) \leq 2 \cdot \fillrad_\theta(\cM))
\]
if \(\img_\theta(\cM) \neq 0\).

%\ling{I think the notation $\fillrad$ is too suggestive. It is a quantity we `create' to describe the barcode estimates. It might have deeper meanings, but we are not present those.}

\subsection{General estimates}\label{ss:barcode_general}

Let \(\cM\) be a closed Riemannian manifold with diameter \(R\), \(\degp \in \N\), and \(\theta \in \cO(\ell,\degp)\).
We will simplify notation writing \(\alpha = \crit(\cM)\), \(\beta_m = \firstdeath{\degp}{\cM}\), and \(\gamma_\theta = \firstdeath{\theta}{\cM}\).

Because $\VR_r(\cM)$ is empty for \(r \leq 0\) and the homotopy type of $\VR_r(\cM)$ remains the homotopy type of $\cM$ for $r \in (0, \alpha)$, bars in \(\barc \rH_\degp^{\VR}(\cM)\) and $\barc\img_\theta^{\VR}(\cM)$ either start at $0$ or start after $\alpha$.

More precisely,
%we estimate the reduced homology barcode of $\cM$ by considering two cases.
if \(k = \dim \opH_\degp(\cM) > 0\) then $\barc\rH_\degp^{\VR}(\cM)$ contains $(0, \beta_m)$ and \((k - 1)\) additional bars of the form \((0, b)\) with \(\beta_m \leq b \leq R\).
Additionally, all other bars are dominated by \((\alpha, R)\).
Recall that a bar $(a, b)$ is said to be dominated by another $(c,d)$ if $c \leq a < b \leq d$.
If \(\dim \opH_\degp(\cM) = 0\) then all bars in \(\barc\rH_\degp^{\VR}(\cM)\) are dominated by \((\alpha, R)\).
See the first row of \cref{fig:barcodes_general} for a pictorial representation of these estimates.

A similar analysis applies to $\barc\img_\theta^{\VR}(\cM)$.
See the second row of \cref{fig:barcodes_general} these estimates.
