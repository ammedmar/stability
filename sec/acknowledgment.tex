%\lz{(Here, I tried to recall what help we got from different people:)
%We thank Prof. Facundo Mémoli for his insightful discussions during the early stages of this work. We are grateful to Prof. Henry Adams for his valuable input on the Vietoris–Rips filtration of real projective spaces (I am not sure how to write this part better. The point is that Henry had Zoom meetings with me to help me understand the group action paper) and for sharing Benjamin Barham's correction to the definition of strong $r$-diameter actions. We also thank Benjamin Barham for permitting us to reference his unpublished results.}
