\begin{abstract}
	When filtered spaces are considered, persistent homology is central tool in applied and theoretical topology.
	But, just like homology of unfiltered spaces, it forgets much structure present in the homotopy type of filtered spaces.
	In this work we systematically study the persistent version of cohomology operations, establishing abstract stability for their associated barcodes, and Gromov--Hausdorff estimates that illustrate the additional discriminatory power introduced by these invariants in the study of Rips--complexes of continuous metric spaces.
