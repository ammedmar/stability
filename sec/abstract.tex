	When working with filtered spaces, persistent homology is a central tool in both applied and theoretical topology. However, similar to the shortcomings of homology for the study of unfiltered homotopy types, persistent homology overlooks much of the inherent structure of their filtered counterparts. In this work, we systematically investigate persistent cohomology operations, establish their stability, and provide product formulas for their associated barcodes. Leveraging these results, we derive Gromov--Hausdorff estimates that underscore the enhanced discriminatory power of these invariants in the analysis of Vietorisâ€“Rips complexes of both discrete and continuous metric spaces.
