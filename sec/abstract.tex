\begin{abstract}
	We establish the foundations of the theory of persistent cohomology operations, derive decomposition formulas for wedge sums and products, and prove their Gromov--Hausdorff stability.
	We use these results to construct pairs of Riemannian pseudomanifolds for which the Gromov--Hausdorff estimates derived from persistent cohomology operations are strictly sharper than those obtained using persistent homology.
