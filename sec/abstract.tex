%	Persistent homology is a central tool for the study of filtered spaces in both applied and theoretical topology.
%	However, as with homology in the context of unfiltered homotopy types, persistent homology fails to capture much of the inherent structure of their filtered counterparts.
	We establish the foundations of the theory of persistent cohomology operations, derive decomposition formulas for wedge sums and products, and prove their Gromovâ€“Hausdorff stability.
	We use these results to construct pairs of Riemannian pseudomanifolds for which the Gromov--Hausdorff estimates derived from persistent cohomology operations are strictly sharper than those obtained using persistent homology.
