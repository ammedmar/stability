	When working with filtered spaces, persistent homology is a central tool in both applied and theoretical topology. However, like the homology of unfiltered spaces, it overlooks much of the structure inherent in the homotopy type of filtered spaces. In this work, we systematically investigate persistent cohomology operations, establishing abstract stability results and product formulas for their associated barcodes. Leveraging these results, we derive Gromov–Hausdorff estimates that underscore the enhanced discriminatory power of these invariants in the analysis of Vietoris–Rips complexes of continuous metric spaces.
