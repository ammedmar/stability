	Persistent homology is a central tool for the study of filtered spaces in both applied and theoretical topology. However, similar to the shortcomings of homology when studying unfiltered homotopy types, persistent homology overlooks much of the inherent structure of their filtered counterparts. In this work, we systematically investigate persistent cohomology operations, establish their stability, and provide product formulas for their associated barcodes. Leveraging these results, we derive Gromov--Hausdorff estimates that underscore the enhanced discriminatory power of these invariants in the analysis of Vietoris--Rips complexes of metric spaces.
