	Persistent homology is a central tool for the study of filtered spaces in both applied and theoretical topology.
	However, as with homology in the context of unfiltered homotopy types, persistent homology fails to capture much of the inherent structure of their filtered counterparts.
	In this work, we establish the foundations of the theory of persistent cohomology operations, deriving decomposition formulas for wedge sums and products, and proving their Gromov–Hausdorff stability.
	By leveraging these results, together with generalizations of Gromov’s filling radius, we construct pairs of Riemannian pseudomanifolds for which the estimates derived from these new invariants are strictly sharper than those obtained using persistent homology.
