\section{Barcode estimates}\label{s:computations}

\subsection{$n$-sphere}\label{ss:Sn}

For any integer $n \geq 1$ and real number $r > 0$, let $\bS^n(r)$ be the \defn{$n$-sphere} of radius $r$ centered at the origin of $\R^{n+1}$.
We consider it equipped with the geodesic distance.

\subsubsection{}

Because the Vietoris--Rips complexes of $\bS^n$ are contractible when the scale parameter $t>\pi$, no standard or Steenrod bar can stay alive after $\pi$.
Therefore, all bars are dominated by $(0, \pi)$.

\subsubsection{} 

Recall from \cite[Thm.~10]{lim2020vietoris} that for $n \in \N$ and  $0 < r \leq \zeta_n$, where $\zeta_n = \arccos(\tfrac{-1}{n+1})$, the space $\VR_r(\bS^n)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\bS^n$.\anibal{Is this the right citation?}
\footnote{The case $n = 1$ has more information.
	From \cite[Thm.~7.4]{adamaszek2017vietoris} it is known that $\VR_r(\bS^1)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\bS^{2n+1}$ for any $n \in \N$ and $\frac{2n\pi}{2n+1} < r \leq \frac{2(n+1)\pi}{2n+3}$.
	Therefore, for any degree~$d$,
	\[
	\barc \rH_{d}(\bS^1) =
	\begin{cases}
		\set[\big]{\big(\tfrac{2\ell\pi}{2\ell+1}, \tfrac{2(\ell+1)\pi}{2\ell+3}\big)} & d = 2\ell+1, \\
		\hfil\emptyset & d = 2\ell.
	\end{cases}
	\]
	
	For $n > 1$, the case $d=1$ also has more information.
	Recall that a metric space $(\cX, d)$ is said to be a \defn{geodesic space} if for each $x, y \in \cX$ there exists geodesic from $x$ to $y$ of length $d(x, y)$.
	As stated in \cite[Prop.~7.10]{virk20201} one knows that if $\cX$ be a simply-connected geodesic space, then $\barc\rH_1(\cX) = \emptyset$.
	Since the spheres we are considering are geodesic their $\rH_1$ barcode is empty.}
This implies that, for any degree $d$, all bars in $\barc\rH_d(\VR(\bS^n))$ are dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$ with the exception of a single bar $(0,\zeta_n)$ when $d = n$ (see Figure \ref{fig:Sk}).\anibal{Notice that I am treating the case $n=1$ in here as well since the claims also hold there. I moved the extra information to the footnote.}
%Therefore, for $n \geq 2$, \cref{ss:simply connected geodesic spaces} implies that $\Hbarc{1}{\bS^n} = \emptyset$, since $\$

%we have the following (see Figure \ref{fig:Sk}):
%\begin{itemize}
%%	\item $\Hbarc{1}{\bS^n} = \emptyset$, by \cref{prop:homotopy type} \cref{ss:simply connected geodesic spaces}.
%	%\facundo{(VR-PH1 of any geodesic metric space is trivial. See papers by Virk. (The Claim also follows from your own work on persistent homotopy groups.))}
%	\item $\Hbarc{n}{\bS^n}$ consists of one bar $(0,\zeta_n)$ (by Proposition \ref{prop:homotopy type} (\ref{ss:filling_radius})) and possibly some bars dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$ (by Proposition \ref{prop:homotopy type} (\ref{prop:Sn})).
%	\item For any degree $p \geq 2$ and $p \neq n$, the only possible bars in $\Hbarc{p}{\bS^n}$ are those dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$.
%	This follows from Proposition \ref{prop:homotopy type} (\ref{prop:Sn}).
%\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\input{sec/table_sphere}
	\caption{Estimation of the $\rH_d$ barcode of $\bS^n$.
		In each figure, the gray area represents the only region, apart from the blue dot, where points could potentially exist within the corresponding barcode.
		Here, and throughout the paper, $\zeta_n = \arccos(\tfrac{-1}{n+1})$ and $\rH_d$ denotes reduced $d$-homology.}
	\label{fig:Sk}
\end{figure}

Similarly, for any linear cohomology operation $\theta \in \cO(\ell,m)$ with $\ell \neq m$, every bar in the barcode of $\img\theta_{\VR(\bS^n)}$ is dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$.

%We study the Steenrod barcodes of $\bS^n$.
%For any $k \in \Z_{\geq 1}$, the Steenrod square operation $\Sq^k$ is trivial for $\bS^n$.
%Combined with Proposition \ref{prop:homotopy type} (\ref{prop:Sn}), we conclude that no Steenrod bars can be born before $\zeta_n$.
%Thus, all bars in $\sqbarc{k}{\bS^n}$ are those dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$.

\subsection{Wedge sums}

The \defn{wedge sum} $(\cX_1, x_1) \vee (\cX_2, x_2)$ (or simply $\cX_1 \vee \cX_2$) of two pointed metric spaces $(\cX_1, x_1)$ and $(\cX_2, x_2)$ is the quotient space of the disjoint union of $\cX_1$ and $\cX_2$ by the identification of basepoints $x_1 \sim x_2$.

The \defn{gluing metric} on the wedge sum of $n$ metric spaces, denoted $\bigvee_{i=1}^n \cX_i$, is given by
\[
d(x_i', x_j') = d_{\cX_i}(x_i', x_i) + d_{\cX_j}(x_j', x_j)
\]
if $x_i' \in \cX_i$ and $x_j' \in \cX_j$ with $i \neq j$, and agrees with $d_{\cX_i}$ if $i = j$.

%and $d_{\cX_1 \vee \cX_2} \vert_{\cX_1 \times \cX_1} = d_{\cX_1},d_{\cX_1 \vee \cX_2} \vert_{\cX_2 \times \cX_2} = d_{\cX_2}$.
%Notice that the above definition can be generalized to the case when we glue $n$ pointed metric spaces $(\cX_1,x_1),\cdots,(\cX_n,x_n)$ by identifying $x_i\sim x_j$ for all $1 \leq i,j\leq n$.
%More generally, the gluing metric on the space $\bigvee_{i=1}^n \cX_i$ is
%\[
%d_{\bigvee_{i=1}^n \cX_i}(x_i',x_j') = d_{\cX_i}(x_i',x_i)+d_{\cX_j}(x_j',x_j),\forall i\neq j, x_i' \in \cX_i, x_j' \in \cX_j
%\]
%and $d_{\cX_i \vee \cX_i}|_{\cX_i\times \cX_i} = d_{\cX_i}$ for any $1\leq i\leq n$.

\subsubsection{}\label{prop:wedge sum}
Recall from \cite[Proposition 3.7]{adamaszek2020homotopy} that the Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric gluing is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of the Vietoris--Rips complexes.
From this, we deduce the following.
%\facundo{A priory, parameter wise homotopy equivalences do not guarantee same barcodes. One has to have some commutativity. See paper with Osman and Sunhyuk.}
%\ling{I have added the reference}
\anibal{Proposition 3.7 doesn't seem to exist in the paper \cite{adamaszek2020homotopy}}

\medskip\proposition
Let $\cX$ and $\cY$ be two compact metric spaces.
For any degree $d$ we have
\[
\rH_d(\VR(\cX \vee \cY)) \cong \rH_d(\VR(\cX)) \oplus \rH_d(\VR(\cY)),
\]
and, for any cohomology operation $\theta$, we have
\begin{align*}
	\img\theta_{\VR(\cX \vee \cY)} &\cong \img\theta_{\VR(\cX)} \oplus \img\theta_{\VR(\cY)}, \\
	\ker\theta_{\VR(\cX \vee \cY)} &\cong \ker\theta_{\VR(\cX)} \oplus \ker\theta_{\VR(\cY)}.
\end{align*}
%\begin{proof}
%	Item (\ref{prop:wedge sum pH}) follows from \cite[Proposition 3.7]{adamaszek2020homotopy} and \cite[Thoerem 6.1 (2)]{lim2020vietoris}.
%	
%	\ling{add the proof of Item (\ref{prop:wedge sum Sq}).}
%\end{proof}

\subsubsection{}

For $n, \ell_1, \dots, \ell_n \in \N^n$ let
\[
\VS^{\ell_1,\dots,\ell_n} = 
\overbrace{\bS^1\vee\dots\vee\bS^1}^{\ell_1} \vee\dots\vee \overbrace{\bS^n\vee\dots\vee\bS^n}^{\ell_n}.
%(\bS^1)^{\vee m_1} \vee \dots \vee (\bS^n)^{\vee m_n}.
\]
The barcode of its $d$-homology contains $m_d$ copies of $(0,\zeta_p)$ and possibly other bars dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$.
This holds for all degrees with the convention that $m_d = 0$ for $d > n$.

Similarly, for any linear cohomology operation $\theta \in \cO(\ell,m)$ with $\ell \neq m$, every bar in its $\img\theta$ barcode is dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$.
%(top row of Figure \ref{fig:sq barcodes}).

%\proposition For a degree $d$, denote $\barc\rH_d(\VS^{(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_n)})$ simply as $B_d$.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item $B_1$ is the multiset containing $r_1$ copies of $(0,\tfrac{2\pi}{3})$.
%	\item If $1 < d \leq n$, 
%\end{enumerate}
%
%Using Example \ref{ss:Sn} and Proposition \ref{prop:wedge sum} (\ref{prop:wedge sum pH}), we obtain an estimate of the barcodes of $\VS^n$ defined as $\bS^1 \vee \bS^2 \vee \dots \vee \bS^n$, illustrated in the top row of Figure \ref{fig:barcodes}.
%Explicitly, we have the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item $\Hbarc{1}{\VS^n}$ contains only one bar $(0,\tfrac{2\pi}{3})$.
%	\item For any degree $2 \leq p \leq n$, $\Hbarc{p}{\VS^n}$ contains one bar $(0,\zeta_p)$, and possibly some bars dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$.
%	For instance, when $p=2l+1$ is odd, $\Hbarc{p}{\VS^n}$ contains the bar $( \tfrac{2l\pi}{2l+1},\tfrac{2(l+1)\pi}{2l+3})$ which is dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$.
%	\item For any degree $p>n$, all bars in $\Hbarc{p}{\VS^n}$ are dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$.
%\end{itemize}



%\subsubsection{} Using Example \ref{ss:Sn} and Proposition \ref{prop:wedge sum} (\ref{prop:wedge sum Sq}), we see that all bars in the Steenrod barcodes of $\VS^n$ are dominated by $\cup_{1\leq i\leq n}(\zeta_i,\pi)=(\zeta_n,\pi)$, so they can be illustrated as in the top row of Figure \ref{fig:sq barcodes}.

\subsection{$n$-projective space}

\subsubsection{}\label{prop:RPn bar}
\lemma For integers $1 \leq p \leq n$,
\[
\left(0, \tfrac{2\pi}{3}\right) \in \Hbarc{p}{\rp^n}.
\]

\begin{proof}
	We will use an induction argument on $n$.
	When $n = 1$, \cref{ss:filling_radius} implies that
	\[
	(0, 2\fillrad{\rp^1}) = \left(0, \tfrac{2\pi}{3}\right) \in \Hbarc{1}{\rp^1}.
	\]
	Assume the statement holds for $\rp^{n-1}$.
	That is, for any $1 \leq p \leq n-1$,
	\[
	\left(0, \tfrac{2\pi}{3}\right) \in \Hbarc{p}{\rp^{n-1}}.
	\]
	Let $t, \epsilon > 0$ be small.
	We claim that the following diagram of topological spaces commutes:
	\begin{equation}\label{d:fundamental_bars_diagram}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\rp^{n-1}
			\ar[d, hook,"{\iota}" left]
			&
			\VR_t(\rp^{n-1})
			\ar[d, hook,"\iota_t"]
			\ar[l, "\rho^{n-1}" above, "\simeq" below]
			\ar[r, hook]
			&
			\VR_{\tfrac{2\pi}{3}+\epsilon}(\rp^{n-1})
			\ar[d, hook]
			\\
			\rp^{n}
			&
			\VR_t(\rp^{n})
			\ar[l, "\rho^n" below, "\simeq" above]
			\ar[r, hook]
			&
			\VR_{\tfrac{2\pi}{3}+\epsilon}(\rp^{n}).
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation}
	In the above diagram, the horizontal inclusions are induced by the Vietoris--Rips filtration, whereas the vertical maps are induced by the equatorial inclusion of real projective spaces $\iota \colon \rp^{n-1} \hookrightarrow \rp^{n}$.
	It is therefore clear that the right square of \eqref{d:fundamental_bars_diagram} commutes.
	
	We now construct the remaining two maps $\rho^{n-1}$ and $\rho^{n}$ as in \cite[\textsection 4.3]{adams2022metric}.
	Let $f^n$ be the composition
	\[
	f^n \colon \VR_t(\bS^n) \to \R^{n+1} \setminus \set{0} \xra{\pi^n} \bS^{n},
	\]
	where the first map sends a formal linear sum $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i x_i$ in $\VR_t(\bS^n)$ to the sum $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i x_i \in \bbR^{n+1}$ where $x_i \in \bS^{n}$ and $\lambda_i \in \bbR$, and the second map $\pi^n$ is the radial projection map.\anibal{How are points in the VR cpx represented by formal sum? Probably this will be address in \cref{ss:vietoris-rips}} 
        \ling{Here, I was not distinguishing a simplicial complex with its geometric realization. The linear sums are actually points in the geometric realization of VR cpx.}
	Because $f^n$ preserves the equivalence relation $x \sim -x$, we have the induced map %\anibal{Maybe use superscripts for these maps and the $\rho$ too?}
	\[
	f^n/\sim \colon \VR_t(\bS^{n})/\sim\to \bS^{n}/\sim\cong \rp^n.
	\]
	Because $t < \tfrac{2\pi}{3}$, it follows from \cite[Lemma 4.4]{adams2022metric} that the map
	\[
	\alpha^n \colon \VR_t(\rp^n) \to \VR_t(\bS^n)/\sim \text{ with }
	\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i [x_i] \mapsto \left[\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i x_i\right]
	\]
	is a homeomorphism, where $x_i \in \bS^{n}$, $\lambda_i \in \bbR$, and $[\cdot]$ denotes the equivalence class of an element under the relation $x \sim -x$. \ling{check if $\sum \lambda_i = 1$.}
	We define
	\[\rho^n = \alpha^n \circ f^n/\sim \]
	It is shown in \cite[Theorem 4.5]{adams2022metric} that $\rho^n$ is a homotopy equivalence from $\VR_t(\rp^n)$ to $\rp^n$ for any $n$.
	% In summary, we have defined the map
	% \[\rho^n: \VR_t(\rp^n)\xrightarrow{\cong} \VR_t(\bS^n)/\sim\to \bS^{n}/\sim\cong \rp^n\]
	
	We claim that the left square in the previous diagram commutes, i.e. $\iota \circ \rho^{n-1}=\rho^{n} \circ \iota_t$.
	Indeed, for any $y = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i [x_i] \in \VR_t(\rp^{n-1})$, we have
	\begin{center}
		$(\iota \circ \rho^{n-1})(y)
		=\iota(f^{n-1}/\sim([\sum_i \lambda_i x_i]))
		=\iota([f^{n-1}(\sum_i \lambda_i x_i)])
		=[\pi^{n-1}(\sum_i \lambda_i x_i)]
		$
	\end{center}
	as an element in $\rp^n$, and
	\begin{center}
		$(\rho^{n} \circ \iota_t)(y) = \rho^{n}(y) = f^{n}/\sim([\sum_i \lambda_i x_i]) = [f^{n}(\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i x_i)] = [\pi^{n}(\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i x_i)]
		$
	\end{center}
	Because $\pi^{n}$ restricted to $\rp^{n-1}$ is equal to $\pi^{n-1}$, we conclude that $(\iota \circ \rho^{n-1})(y) = (\rho^n \circ \iota_t)(y)$ for any $y$.
	Thus, the claim holds.
	
	For each $1\leq p\leq n-1$, applying the $p$-th homology functor (over $\Ftwo$) to the above diagram, we obtain the following commutative diagram of vector spaces:
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\rH_p(\rp^{n-1})
		\ar[d, "\cong" left]
		&
		\rH_p(\VR_t(\rp^{n-1}))
		\ar[d, "\rH_p(\iota_t)" left, "\cong" right, myred]
		\ar[l, "\cong" above]
		\ar[r, "g^{n-1}=0", myred]
		&
		\rH_p(\VR_{\tfrac{2\pi}{3}+\epsilon}(\rp^{n-1}))
		\ar[d]
		\\
		\rH_p(\rp^{n})
		&
		\rH_p(\VR_t(\rp^{n}))
		\ar[l, "\cong"]
		\ar[r, "g^n" , myred]
		&
		\rH_p(\VR_{\tfrac{2\pi}{3}+\epsilon}(\rp^{n})).
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	By induction assumption, $(0, \tfrac{2\pi}{3})\in\Hbarc{p}{\rp^{n-1}}$, which implies that $g^{n-1}$ is the zero map.
	Commutativity of the left-hand side square further implies that $\rH_p(\iota_t)$ is an isomorphism.
	Then, using the right-hand side square's commutativity, we deduce $g^n \circ \rH_p(\iota_t)=0$.
	Since $\rH_p(\iota_t)$ is an isomorphism, we conclude that $g^n=0$.
	This holds for any $\epsilon>0$, so we can conclude $(0, \tfrac{2\pi}{3})\in\Hbarc{p}{\rp^{n}}$.
	
	For the case when $p=n$, we can apply Item (\ref{ss:filling_radius}) to observe that $(0,2\fillrad{\rp^n}) = (0, \tfrac{2\pi}{3}) \in \Hbarc{n}{\rp^n}$.
	Therefore, $(0, \tfrac{2\pi}{3}) \in \Hbarc{p}{\rp^n}$ is established for all $1\leq p\leq n.$
\end{proof}

We will refer to the bar in this lemma as the \defn{fundamental bar} of $\rp^n$.

\subsubsection{} Because the Vietoris--Rips complexes of $\rp^n$ are contractible when the scale parameter $t>\pi$, neither the standard barcodes nor the Steenrod barcodes can stay alive after $\pi$.
Therefore, all bars are dominated by $(0,\pi)$.

For the standard barcodes of $\rp^n$, by applying Proposition \ref{prop:homotopy type} (\ref{prop:RPn}) and (\ref{prop:RPn bar}), %and the fact that $\opH_p(\rp^n;\,\Ftwo)$ is $\Ftwo$ for $p\leq n$ and $0$ otherwise,
we obtain the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For any $1 \leq p \leq n$, $\Hbarc{p}{\rp^n}$ contains one bar $(0,\tfrac{2\pi}{3})$ and possibly some bars dominated by $(\tfrac{2\pi}{3}, \pi)$.
	\item For $p>n$, all bars in $\Hbarc{p}{\rp^n}$ are dominated by $(\tfrac{2\pi}{3},\pi)$.
\end{itemize}

%To compute the Steenrod barcodes of $\rp^n$, we first recall the following properties of $\rp^n$:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item The cohomology ring $\opH^*(\rp^n;\,\Ftwo)$ is isomorphic to $\Ftwo[\alpha]/(\alpha^{n+1})$ (see \cite[Theorem 3.19]{hatcher2000});
%	\item The Steenrod operations satisfy $\Sq^k(\alpha^m)=({m \choose k} \mod 2)\alpha^{m+k}$ for any $0\leq k\leq m\leq n$, according to Formula (*) on page 490 of \cite{hatcher2000}.
%	\item For $k>\tfrac{n-1}{2}$, $\Sq^k\equiv 0$.
%	Indeed, for $m\leq \tfrac{n-1}{2} < k$, it follows from \cite[page 489, Item (5)]{hatcher2000} that $\Sq^k(\alpha^m)=0$.
%	For $m> \tfrac{n-1}{2}$, $\Sq^k(\alpha^m)=({m \choose k} \mod 2)\alpha^{m+k}=0$ because $m+k>n-1.$ Thus, $\Sq^k(\alpha^m)=0$ for any $m$.
%\end{itemize}

Let $1 \leq k \leq \tfrac{n-1}{2}$.
Since the Vietoris--Rips complex $\VR_t(\rp^n)$ retains the homotopy type of $\rp^n$ for $t \in (0,\tfrac{2\pi}{3})$, we have at least one bar generated by $\Sq^k(\alpha^k)=\alpha^{2k}$ in the $\Sq^k$--barcode that is born at $0$ and stay alive until the non-trivial degree-$(k+1)$ class $\alpha^{2k}$ dies at $\tfrac{2\pi}{3}$.
Therefore,
\begin{itemize}
	\item For $1\leq k\leq n-1$, $\sqbarc{k}{\rp^n}$ contains one bar $(0,\tfrac{2\pi}{3})$, and possibly some bars dominated by $(\tfrac{2\pi}{3},\pi)$;
	\item For $k>n$, the possible bars in $\sqbarc{k}{\rp^n}$ are $(0,\tfrac{2\pi}{3})$ or those dominated by $(\tfrac{2\pi}{3},\pi)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bottleneck estimates}\label{prop:db estimate}

We estimate the bottleneck distance $\db$ between the Steenrod barcodes of the two space $\VS^n$ and $\rp^n$, and show that it provides a better (lower-bound) approximation of the Gromov--Hausdorff distance than $\db$ between the standard barcodes.

\medskip\theorem
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(1)] $\max_{p\geq 1}\db(\Hbarc{p}{\VS^n}, \Hbarc{p}{\rp^n})\leq \tfrac{\pi-\zeta_n}{2} < \tfrac{\pi}{4}$.
	\smallskip\item[(2)] $\db(\sqbarc{k}{\VS^n}, \sqbarc{k}{\rp^n})\geq \tfrac{\pi}{3},\forall 1\leq k\leq n-1$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{proof}
	For Item (1), recall the barcodes of the two spaces from Figure \ref{fig:barcodes}, and note that to prove the bottleneck distance is upper bounded by $\tfrac{\pi-\zeta_n}{2}$, it is enough to find one matching with cost no larger than this value.
	Recall that $\zeta_p = \arccos(\tfrac{-1}{p+1})$, and thus,
	\[
	\tfrac{\pi}{2} < \zeta_n < \dots < \zeta_1 = \tfrac{2\pi}{3}.
	\]
	For any degree $1\leq p\leq n$, consider a matching such that $(0,\zeta_p)\rightarrow (0,\tfrac{2\pi}{3})$ and all other points are matched to the diagonal.
	The cost of this matching is at most
	\[
	\max\{\tfrac{2\pi}{3}-\zeta_p,\,\tfrac{\pi-\zeta_p}{2} \} = \tfrac{\pi-\zeta_p}{2} < \tfrac{\pi-\zeta_n}{2}.
	\]
	For degree $p>n$, consider a matching such that all points are matched to the diagonal, whose cost is at most
	\[
	\max\{\tfrac{\pi-\zeta_n}{2}, \tfrac{\pi-\tfrac{2\pi}{3}}{2} \} = \tfrac{\pi-\zeta_n}{2} < \tfrac{\pi}{4}.
	\]
	
	For Item (2), recall the Steenrod barcodes of the two spaces from Figure \ref{fig:sq barcodes}.
	For any $1\leq k\leq n-1$, the bar $(0,\tfrac{2\pi}{3})$ in $\sqbarc{k}{\rp^n}$ can be mapped to either the diagonal or a point whose first coordinate is larger than or equal to $\zeta_n$.
	Therefore, a matching between the $\Sq^k$--barcodes will have a cost that is at least 
        \[\min\{\tfrac{1}{2}\cdot\tfrac{2\pi}{3}, \|(0, \tfrac{2\pi}{3}) - (\zeta_n, \zeta_n)\|_{\infty}\} = \min\{\tfrac{1}{2}\cdot\tfrac{2\pi}{3}, \zeta_n\} = \tfrac{\pi}{3}.\]
\end{proof}

\cref{prop:db estimate} shows that the Steenrod barcodes can have a stronger distinguishing power than the standard barcodes in all degrees.
