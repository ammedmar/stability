\section{Critical Radii and Spherical Quotients}\label{s:barcodes}

In this section, we extend Gromov's concept of the filling radius to provide estimates for the Vietoris--Rips \(\theta\)-barcodes \lz{Should we mention homology barcodes as well?} of metric spaces.
The primary examples analyzed include wedge sums and quotients of round spheres.
