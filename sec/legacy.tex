\begin{enumerate}
	\item Importance of stability of regular barcode.
	\item Value of \textbf{effective computation} of Steenrod barcodes.
	\item Appeal of a stability result for these.
	\item Existence of stability results for cohomology with additional structure.
	In particular with a module structure over the Steenrod algebra.
	\item The result follows from using a forgetful functor on this framework.
	\item A self-contained proof is available.
