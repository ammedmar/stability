\section{Persistent Cohomology operations}\label{s:steenrod}

%\subsection{$K(\pi, n)$ spaces and cohomology operations}

%We review classical material as presented, for example, in \cite{mosheroperations1968}.
%To be consistent with the existing literature we let $\pi$ be an abelian group.
%, not to be confused with homotopy groups denoted $\pi_n$ for $n \geq 0$.
%For the applications of the ideas in this subsection the persistence context $\pi$ will be assumed to be a field.

\subsection{Persistent $\theta$-modules}

\subsubsection{}

Any cohomology operation $\theta \in \cO(\kk,n; \kk,m)$ defines a natural morphism of persistence modules $\theta_X \colon \rH^n(X; \k) \to \rH^m(X; \k)$ for any $\R$-space $X$.
The \defn{image persistent $\theta$-module} $\img(\theta_X)$ is defined by
\[
\img(\theta_X)_r = \img((\theta_X)_r)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\img(\theta)_{s,t} = W_{s,t}\big|_{\img(\theta_s)}\,.
\]
Since the structure maps of $\img \theta$ are restrictions of structure maps of a q-tame module, the persistence module $\img(\theta)$ is q-tame.
A similar construction defines the \defn{kernel persistence module} $\ker(\theta)$.


If $X$ is q-tame, we define its \defn{$\theta$-barcode} as the barcode of $\img\theta_X$.

For example, taking $\theta$ to be the identity map in degree $n$, the $\theta$-barcode of $X$ is equal to the barcode of the persistent $n$-cohomology of $X$ with $\k$ coefficients.
