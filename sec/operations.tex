\section{Persistent cohomology operations}\label{s:steenrod}

%\subsection{$K(\pi, n)$ spaces and cohomology operations}

%We review classical material as presented, for example, in \cite{mosheroperations1968}.
%To be consistent with the existing literature we let $\pi$ be an abelian group.
%, not to be confused with homotopy groups denoted $\pi_n$ for $n \geq 0$.
%For the applications of the ideas in this subsection the persistence context $\pi$ will be assumed to be a field.
