\section{Persistent Cohomology operations}\label{s:steenrod}

%\subsection{$K(\pi, n)$ spaces and cohomology operations}

%We review classical material as presented, for example, in \cite{mosheroperations1968}.
%To be consistent with the existing literature we let $\pi$ be an abelian group.
%, not to be confused with homotopy groups denoted $\pi_n$ for $n \geq 0$.
%For the applications of the ideas in this subsection the persistence context $\pi$ will be assumed to be a field.

\subsection{Persistent $\theta$-modules}

\subsubsection{}

A cohomology operation $\theta \in \cO(\kk,m; \kk,n)$ is said to be \defn{linear}, if $\k$ is a field and the map $\theta_{\cX} \colon \rH^m(\cX; \k) \to \rH^n(\cX; \k)$ is linear for any topological space $\cX$.
We denote this subset of cohomology operations by $\cO(m,n;\k)$.
For any prime $p$, the field $\Z/p$ is additively generated, so all cohomology operations in $\cA_p$ are linear.\footnote{An example of an additive map that is not linear is complex conjugation $\bC \to \bC$.}

A linear cohomology operation defines a natural morphism of persistence modules $\theta_X \colon \rH^n(X; \k) \to \rH^m(X; \k)$ for any $\R$-space $X$.
The \defn{image} and \defn{kernel} of $\theta$, denoted $\img\theta$ and $\ker\theta$ respectively, are natural persistence modules defined for any $\R$-space $X$ by
\begin{align*}
	\img(\theta_X)_r &= \img((\theta_X)_r)\,, &
	\ker(\theta_X)_r &= \ker((\theta_X)_r)\,, \\
	\img(\theta_X)_{s,t} &= \rH^n(X;\k)_{s,t}\big|_{\img(\theta_s)}\,, &
	\ker(\theta_X)_{s,t} &= \rH^m(X;\k)_{s,t}\big|_{\ker(\theta_s)}\,,
\end{align*}
the usual notion of image and kernel of a persistence module morphism.

If $X$ is q-tame, the structure maps of $\img\theta$ and $\ker\theta$ are restrictions of structure maps of a q-tame module, therefore $\img(\theta_X)$ and $\ker(\theta_X)$ are q-tame.
In this case we refer to their barcodes as $\theta$-barcodes.
Barcodes of cohomology operations generalize cohomology barcodes since, for the identity and zero maps in $\cO(m,n;\k)$, we have $\img\id_X \cong \ker0_X \cong \rH^n(X;\k)$..

\subsection{Products}

\subsubsection{}
The \defn{wedge sum} $\cX \vee \cY$ of two pointed spaces is the quotient of their disjoint union by the identification of basepoints.
Given two base point preserving maps $f \colon \cX_1 \to \cX_2$ and $g \colon \cY_1 \to \cY_2$ the map $(f \vee g) \colon \cX_1 \vee \cY_1 \to \cX_2 \vee \cY_2$ is given by
\[
(f \vee g)(z) =
\begin{cases}
	f(z) & z \in \cX_1, \\
	g(z) & z \in \cY_1.\\
\end{cases}
\]

\subsubsection{}
For any two pointed $\R$-spaces $X$ and $Y$, the pointed $\R$-space $X \vee Y$, is defined by
\[
(X \vee Y)_r = X_r \vee Y_r \quad\text{and}\quad (X \vee Y)_{s,t} = (X_{s,y} \vee Y_{s,t}).
\]

\medskip\theorem For any linear cohomology operation $\theta$,
\begin{align*}
	\img\theta_{X \vee Y} &\cong \img\theta_X \oplus \img\theta_Y, \\
	\ker\theta_{X \vee Y} &\cong \ker\theta_X \oplus \ker\theta_Y.
\end{align*}

\begin{proof}
%	This follows from naturality and the usual isomorphism $(\iota_\cX \oplus \iota_\cY) \colon \rH^n(\cX \vee \cY; \k) \xra{\cong} \rH^n(\cX; \k) \oplus \rH^n(\cY; \k)$ where $\iota$ denotes the inclusion of a summand into the wedge sum.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{}

Similarly, for any two $\R$-spaces $X$ and $Y$, the $\R$-space $X \times Y$, is defined by
\[
(X \vee Y)_r = X_r \vee Y_r \quad\text{and}\quad (X \vee Y)_{s,t} = (X_{s,y} \vee Y_{s,t}).
