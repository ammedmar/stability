\section{Notes (Excluded from Final Paper)}

This section contains our notes regarding the complex projective spaces, the quaternionic projective spaces, and lens spaces.

\subsection{$\VR(\cp^n)$}

\cite[Corollary 7.10]{lim2020vietoris} states that there exists some $\alpha_n\in (0,\arccos(-1/3))$ such that $\VR_r(\cp^n)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\cp^n$ for any $r\in (0,\alpha_n)$. 
This is not enough for us, because we want a `long' enough bar in the usual barcode (assuming the Steenrod barcode is almost trivial). 

If we consider the rational coefficients, then the rational filling radius of $\cp^n$ being $1/2\arccos(-1/3)$ can be helpful to us. %reference: \url{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166864191901223}
The proposition in \cref{ss:filling_radius} gives the fundamental bar  $(0,\arccos(-1/3))\in \Hbarc[\mathbb{Q}]{p}{\cM}$.

The next question will be what are the Steenrod barcodes (over $\mathbb{Q}$) of $\cp^n$. This can still be a hard question, because we do not know the homotopy type of $\VR_r(\cp^n)$ for $r$ in the fundamental bar.

\textcolor{blue}{to-do's for Ling: reorganize Section 5.5; identify a bound for '$\alpha_n$'; use this bound to decide what analysis we are seeking for other spaces. Mention the gaps we have, e.g. what is lacking if we were to apply the same approach ($\VR(S^n/\sim)\simeq \VR(S^n)/\sim$ is not that difficult, but $\VR(S^n)/\sim$ is hard to understand)}
