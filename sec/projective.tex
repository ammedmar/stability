\subsection{Real projective spaces}\label{s:first_critical_value_rpn}

Let us now focus on the real equatorial system with the antipodal action.
We will consider every sphere \(\bS^n(2)\) to have radius 2 so the quotient \(\rp^n\) has the same diameter as \(\bS^n\).
We will consider reduced (co)homology with mod 2 coefficients.

\medskip\proposition
For \(k,\ell,n,m \in \N\) and \(\Sq^k \in \cO(\ell, k+\ell)\) we have:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \(\crit(\rp^n) = \frac{2\pi}{3}\).
	\item \(\firstdeath{m}{\rp^n} =
	\begin{cases}
		\frac{\pi}{3} & 1 \leq m \leq n, \\
		\hfil 0 & \text{otherwise}.
	\end{cases}\)
	\item \(\firstdeath{\Sq^k}{\rp^n} =
	\begin{cases}
		\tfrac{\pi}{3} & k \leq \frac{n-1}{2} \text{ and } \binom{\ell}{k} \text{ is odd},\\
		\hfil 0 & \text{otherwise}. \\
	\end{cases}\)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
	(1) This proposition is stated and proven in \cite[Thm.~4.5]{adams2022metric}.

	(2) We only need to prove for the case of $1\leq m\leq n$, since the other case is follows from definition since \(\rH_m(\rp^n) = 0\) if \(m > n\) or \(m = 0\).
	Recall from \cite{katz1983filling} that the filling radius of $\rp^n$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$ for any $n \geq 1$.
	By \cref{subsub:foundamental_bar_rpn_lemma}, we have that $\firstdeath{m}{\rp^n}\leq \tfrac{\pi}{3}$.
	On the other hand, $\firstdeath{m}{\rp^n}\geq \tfrac{1}{2}\crit(\rp^n) = \tfrac{\pi}{3}$.

	(3) We only need a proof for the case $k \leq \frac{n-1}{2}$ and $\binom{\ell}{k}$ odd, since \(\Sq^k = 0\) otherwise.
	Given that $\VR_r(\rp^n)$ retains the homotopy type of $\rp^n$ for $r \in [0,\tfrac{2\pi}{3})$, \anibal{Recall the cohomology ring in order to use the generator \(\sigma\)} and $\Sq^k(\sigma^\ell) = \binom{\ell}{k}\sigma^{\ell+k}$ generates a bar in $\barc \img_{\Sq^k}$ that is born at $0$ and stays alive until the non-trivial degree-$(\ell+k)$ class $\sigma^{k+\ell}$ dies at $\tfrac{2\pi}{3}$.
	Thus, $\firstdeath{\Sq_\ell^k}{\rp^n} \leq \tfrac{\pi}{3}$.
	On the other hand, $\firstdeath{\Sq^k}{\rp^n} \geq \tfrac{1}{2}\crit(\rp^n) = \tfrac{\pi}{3}$.
\end{proof}

Using the above values, the estimates resulting from the analysis of \cref{ss:barcode_general} are illustrated in \cref{fig:sq barcodes}.

		%When $1\leq \degp \leq n$, the barcode consists of one $(0,\frac{2\pi}{3})$ and potentially some bars dominated by $(\frac{2\pi}{3}, \pi)$.
		\emph{Bottom row:} the $\img_{\Sq_\ell^k}$-barcode of $\rp^n$.
		%The leftmost barcode contains at least one $(0,\frac{2\pi}{3})$ and potentially some bars dominated by $(\frac{2\pi}{3}, \pi)$;

        In each figure, the gray region represents where additional bars could exist within the corresponding barcode.
