\subsection{Real projective spaces} \label{sub:first_critical_value_rpn}

\subsubsection{}

Recall that $\bS^n(\rho)$ denotes the $n$-sphere of radius $\rho$ equipped with the geodesic distance $d$.
The \defn{$n$-real projective space} $\rp^n(r)$ is the quotient space $\bS^n(r)$ by the antipodal map $x \mapsto -x$ for all $x \in \bS^n$.
We equip $\rp^n(r)$ with the quotient metric.
% \[
% d\big([x],[x']\big) =
% \min\set[\big]{d(x, x'), d(-x, x')}.
% \]

To simplify notation we denote $\bS(1)$ by $\bS^n$ and $\rp^n(2)$ by $\rp^n$.
Notice that $\diam(\bS^n) = \diam(\rp^n) = \pi$.

The inclusion of \(\mathbb{S}^n\) into \(\mathbb{S}^{n+1}\) as the equatorial $n$-sphere is equivariant with respect to the antipodal action.
Therefore, it induces an inclusion of \(\rp^n\) into \(\rp^{n+1}\).

%Since the \defn{infinite sphere} \(\mathbb{S}^\infty = \bigcup_n \mathbb{S}^n\) is contractible, its induced projection onto the \defn{real projective space} $\rp^\infty = \bigcup_n \rp^n$ defines its universal cover, so $\rp^\infty$ is a model for \(K(\Z/2, 1)\).

Consider the mod-\(2\) (co)homology of \(\VR(\rp^n)\) and the linear cohomology operations defined by Steenrod squares \(\Sq^k_\ell \in \cO(\ell,\ell+k)\).

\subsubsection{}
\label{subsub:rpn homotopy type}

In certain intervals, the homotopy type of the Vietoris--Rips complex of $\rp^n$ is known.
This information is presented in \cite[Thm.~4.5]{adams2022metric}:
%\label{prop:RPn}{\rm \cite[Thm.~4.5]{adams2022metric}.}
For $r \in (0,\frac{2\pi}{3} ]$,
\[
\VR_r(\rp^n) \simeq \rp^n,
\]
and the homotopy type of $\VR_r(\rp^n)$ changes after $\tfrac{2\pi}{3}$.
In other words,

\medskip\proposition
The first critical value of \(\VR(\rp^n)\) is \(\crit(\rp^n) = \frac{2\pi}{3}\).

\subsubsection{}
\label{subsub:beta_m_rpn}

%We apply \cref{sub:general_barcodes} to prove the following proposition.

\medskip\proposition
$\firstdeath{m}{\rp^n}$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$ for any $1\leq m\leq n$, and $0$ otherwise.

\begin{proof}%[Proof of \cref{subsub:beta_m_rpn}.]
	We only need to prove for the case of $1\leq m\leq n$, since the other case is trivial.
    Recall from \cite{katz1983filling} that the filling radius of $\rp^n$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$ for any $n \geq 1$.
	By considering the $\rC_2$-action on the equatorial system $\bS^m \to \bS^n$ and applying \cref{subsub:foundamental_bar_rpn_lemma}, we have $\firstdeath{m}{\rp^n}\leq \tfrac{\pi}{3}$.
    On the other hand, $\firstdeath{m}{\rp^n}\geq \tfrac{1}{2}\crit(\rp^n) = \tfrac{\pi}{3}$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{}\label{subsub:gamma_rpn}

\medskip\proposition
$\firstdeath{\Sq_\ell^k}{\rp^n}$ is $\tfrac{\pi}{3}$ for $k, \ell$ such that $k \leq \frac{n-1}{2}$ and $\binom{\ell}{k}$ is odd, and $0$ otherwise.

\begin{proof}
	We only need to prove for the case of $k \leq \frac{n-1}{2}$ and $\binom{\ell}{k}$ is odd, as the other case is trivial.
    Since the Vietoris--Rips complex $\VR_r(\rp^n)$ retains the homotopy type of $\rp^n$ for $r \in [0,\tfrac{2\pi}{3})$, $\Sq^k(\sigma^\ell) = \binom{\ell}{k}\sigma^{\ell+k}$ generates a bar in the $\Sq^k_\ell$--barcode that is born at $0$ and stay alive until the non-trivial degree-$(\ell+k)$ class $\sigma^{k+\ell}$ dies at $\tfrac{2\pi}{3}$.
	Thus, $\firstdeath{\Sq_\ell^k}{\rp^n} \leq \tfrac{\pi}{3}$.
	On the other hand, $\firstdeath{\Sq_\ell^k}{\rp^n} \geq \tfrac{1}{2}\crit(\rp^n) = \tfrac{\pi}{3}$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{}\label{sub:barcode_rpn}

We combine results in \cref{subsub:rpn homotopy type}, \cref{subsub:beta_m_rpn} and \cref{subsub:gamma_rpn} with the barcode estimates in \cref{subsub:barcode_general} to derive an estimate for the barcodes of $\rp^n$. 
This is illustrated in \cref{fig:sq barcodes} and will be needed for estimating the bottleneck distance between barcodes.

		%The leftmost barcode contains at least one $(0,\frac{2\pi}{3})$ and potentially some bars dominated by $(\frac{2\pi}{3}, \pi)$;

        In each figure, the gray region represents where additional bars could exist within the corresponding barcode.
