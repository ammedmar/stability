\section{Gromov--Hausdorff estimates}\label{prop:db estimate}

In this section, we aim to construct examples of Riemannian (pseudo-)manifolds for which the Gromov--Hausdorff estimate derived from the stability of persistent cohomology operations provides tighter bounds than those obtained through persistent homology.
This demonstrates the enhanced discriminatory power of these persistent invariants in the context of metric geometry.

Specifically, let us consider, for any \(n \leq 2\), the wedge of Riemannian spheres \(\VS = \bS^1 \vee \dots \vee \bS^n\), where each \(\bS^i\) has diameter \(\pi\).
Additionally, we consider \(\rp^n\), the real projective space obtained as the quotient of \(\bS^n(2)\) under the antipodal action, where \(\bS^n(2)\) denotes the \(n\)-dimensional sphere of radius 2, and the resulting quotient space \(\rp^n\) also has diameter \(\pi\).
Then,

\medskip (1) For any \(m \in \N\) one has
\[
\di\big(\rH^\VR_m(\VS),\, \rH^\VR_m(\rp^n)\big) \leq \frac{\pi}{4}.
\]

(2) There is \(\degp \in \N\) and \(\Sq^k \in \cO(\degp-k, \degp)\) such that
\[
\di\big(\img_{\Sq^k}^\VR(\VS),\, \img_{\Sq^k}^\VR(\rp^n)\big) \geq \frac{\pi}{3}.
\]

We will prove more general statements with the goal of proving similar estimates for Lens spaces.\anibal{This is as far as I went. I would like to know exactly what needs to hold for Lens spaces to get similar estimates}

%We estimate the interleaving distance $\db$ between the Steenrod barcodes of certain pairs of metric spaces and demonstrate that it provides a tighter lower-bound approximation of the Gromovâ€“Hausdorff distance between the spaces than $\db$ between their persistent homology barcodes.
%See the theorem in \cref{subsub:main_theorem} for details.
%Although this theorem is stated for $\bS^1\vee\dots\vee \bS^n$ and $\rp^n$ only, we present our methodology within a more general framework.
%This allows us to identify the essential components of the proof, laying the groundwork for extending these results to other spaces.

\subsubsection{}

Let $\cX$ be a closed connected \(n\)-manifold of diameter $\pi$ such that $\crit(\cX) \geq \zeta_n = \arccos{(-\tfrac{1}{n+1})}$.
Let $\VS \defeq \VS^{\ell_1, \dots, \ell_n}$ with $\ell_i = \dim \opH_i(\cX)$ for each $i = 1,\dots, n$.

%Let $\beta_m$ and $\gamma_\theta$ denote the first critical values of the $m^\th$ reduced homology of $\VR\cX$ and the degree-$m$ component of the $\theta$-barcode of $\VR\cX$, respectively.

\subsection{Upper bound on $\db$ between homology barcodes}\label{subsub:db_upper_bound}

To obtain an upper bound on the bottleneck distance, it suffices to find one matching and compute the cost of it.

\medskip\proposition
For any degree $m$ such that $\opH_m(\cX)$ is non-trivial,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:db_usual_upper_bound}
	\db\big(\Hbarc[\field]{m}{\VS}, \Hbarc[\field]{m}{\cX}\big)
	%\leq \cost(P)
	\leq \max\big\{|\zeta_m  - 2\firstdeath{m}{\cX} |, \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}\big\}.
\end{equation}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\beta_m = 2\firstdeath{m}{\cX}$.
	Consider the matching $P$ between $\Hbarc[\field]{m}{\VS}$ and $\Hbarc[\field]{m}{\cX}$ such that $(0,\zeta_m ) \leftrightarrow (0, \beta_m )$ and all other bars unmatched.
	Using the barcode estimates from \cref{fig:barcodes_general} and \cref{fig:barcodes_vs}, we obtain that %the cost of $P$ satisfies
	\begin{align*}
		\cost(P)
		= & \max\big\{|\zeta_m  - \beta_m |,\, \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2},\, \tfrac{\pi - \alpha}{2}\big\} \\
		= & \max\big\{|\zeta_m  - \beta_m |, \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}\big\} && \mbox{(because $\zeta_n \leq \alpha$)}.
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, \cref{eq:db_usual_upper_bound} holds.
\end{proof}


% For any degree $m > n$, consider the matching $P$ between $\Hbarc[\field]{m}{\VS}$ and $\Hbarc{m}{\cX}$ such that all bars are unmatched. Then the cost of $P$ satisfies:
% \[
%     \cost(P)
%     = \max\{\tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}, \tfrac{\pi - \alpha}{2}\}
%     = \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}.
% \]

\subsection{Lower bound on $\db$ between $\theta$-barcodes}
\label{subsub:db_theta_lower_bound}

To obtain a lower bound on the bottleneck distance, the minimum cost of matching a certain bar is calculated.

\medskip\proposition
Let $\theta \in \cO(\ell, m)$ be a linear cohomology operation such that $\img \theta_\cX$ is non-trivial.
Then,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:db_theta_lower_bound}
	\db\big(\thetabarc{\VS}, \thetabarc{\cX}\big)
	%= \min_Q \cost(Q)
	\geq \min\{\firstdeath{\theta}{\cX}, \zeta_n\}. %\geq \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}.
\end{equation}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\gamma_\theta = 2\firstdeath{\theta}{\cX}$.
	Recall from \cref{fig:barcodes_general} that $\thetabarc{\cX}$ contains a bar $(0,\gamma_\theta)$.
	We calculate the minimum cost of matching the bar $(0,\gamma_\theta)$.

	Let $Q$ be an arbitrary matching between $\thetabarc{\VS}$ and $\thetabarc{\cX}$.
	If $(0,\gamma_\theta )$ is unmatched in $Q$, then $\cost(Q) \geq \tfrac{\gamma_\theta }{2}$.
	If $(0,\gamma_\theta )$ is matched to some bar $(a,b) \in \thetabarc{\VS}$, then
	$\cost(Q) =  \|(0,\gamma_\theta ) - (a,b)\|_\infty \geq a \geq \zeta_n$, because $(a,b) \subset (\zeta_n, \pi)$.
	Thus, an arbitrary matching $Q$ between $\thetabarc{\VS}$ and $\thetabarc{\cX}$ must satisfy $\cost(Q) \geq \min\{\tfrac{\gamma_\theta }{2}, \zeta_n\}.$
	Therefore, \cref{eq:db_theta_lower_bound} holds.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Comparison of distinguishing powers}
\label{subsub:main_theorem}

\subsubsection{}
\label{subsub:comparison_lemma}

We establish a technical lemma.
As before, let $\zeta_n = 2 \cdot \fillrad(\bS^n)$, which decreases as $n$ increases.
In addition, the following relations hold: for any $m \leq n$,
\[\zeta_m - \zeta_n < \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2} < \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}.\]

\medskip\lemma
Let $m \leq n$.

(1) For any $r \in \big[\zeta_n, \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}+\zeta_m\big]$, $\max\big\{|\zeta_m  - r |, \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}\big\} \leq \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}$.

(2) For any $r \in \big[\zeta_n, \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2} + \zeta_m\big]$, $\max\{|\zeta_m  - r |, \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}\} = \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}$.

\begin{proof}
    	(1) Since $\tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2} \leq \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}$, it remains to show $|\zeta_m  - r | \leq \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}$, which follows from
    	\(
    	|\zeta_m  - r | \leq \max\big\{\zeta_m - \zeta_n, \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}\big\} = \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}.
    	\)

    	(2) Assume, in addition, $r \leq \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2} + \zeta_m$.
        To show the desired equality, it suffices to show $|\zeta_m  - r | \leq \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}$.
        We consider two cases.
        When $r > \zeta_m$,
    	$|\zeta_m  - r | = r - \zeta_m \leq
    	%\leq \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2} + \zeta_m - \zeta_m =
        \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}
    	$ is clear.
    	When $r \leq \zeta_m$, we have
    	\(
    	|\zeta_m  - r | \leq \zeta_m - \zeta_n
    	\leq \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}.
    	\)
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{}
By combining results from \cref{subsub:db_upper_bound}, \cref{subsub:db_theta_lower_bound} and \cref{subsub:comparison_lemma}, we deduce that the lower bound of the bottleneck distance $\db$ between the $\theta$-barcodes of the two space $\VS$ and $\cX$ (Equation (\ref{eq:db_theta_lower_bound})) is larger than the upper bound of $\db$ between the persistent homology barcodes of the two spaces (Equation (\ref{eq:db_usual_upper_bound})).
As a consequence, the $\theta$-barcodes provide a better (lower-bound) approximation of the Gromov--Hausdorff distance than $\db$ between the persistent homology barcodes.

\medskip\proposition
If $2\firstdeath{m}{\cX} < \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}+\zeta_m$ and $\theta \in \cO(\ell, m)$ is a linear cohomology operation such that $\img \theta_\cX$ is non-trivial, then
\[\db\big(\thetabarc{\VS}, \thetabarc{\cX}\big) \geq \db\big(\Hbarc[\field]{m}{\VS}, \Hbarc[\field]{m}{\cX}\big).\]

\begin{proof}
    Let $\beta_m = 2\firstdeath{m}{\cX}$ and $\gamma_\theta = 2\firstdeath{\theta}{\cX}$.
    By \cref{eq:db_usual_upper_bound} and \cref{eq:db_theta_lower_bound}, it suffices to show that
    \[
    \min\big\{\tfrac{\gamma_\theta}{2}, \zeta_n\big\} \geq \max\big\{|\zeta_m - \beta_m|, \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}\big\}.
    \]
    Since \(\zeta_n \leq \crit(\cX) \leq \gamma_\theta\), we have
    \(
    \min\big\{\tfrac{\gamma_\theta}{2}, \zeta_n\big\} \geq \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}.
    \)
    On the other hand, because \(\zeta_n \leq \crit(\cX) \leq \beta_m < \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2} + \zeta_m\), applying Part (1) of the lemma in \cref{subsub:comparison_lemma} gives
    \(
    \max\big\{|\zeta_m - \beta_m|, \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}\big\} \leq \tfrac{\zeta_n}{2}.
    \)
    Thus, we have the desired inequality.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{}

In the case of $\cX = \rp^n$ and the cohomology operations $\theta$ being the Steenrod squares, all with mod $2$ coefficients, we have a finer estimate as in the theorem below.
Below, $\VS$ is $\bS^1\vee\dots\vee \bS^n$.

\medskip\theorem
We have
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(1)] $\displaystyle \max_{m\geq 1}\, \db\big(\Hbarc{m}{\VS}, \Hbarc{m}{\rp^n}\big)\leq \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}$.
	\smallskip
    \item[(2)] $\displaystyle \min_{%(k,\ell) \text{ s.t. }
    k \leq \frac{n-1}{2},\, \binom{\ell}{k}\text{ odd}} \db\big(\sqbarcl{k}{\ell}{\VS},\, \sqbarcl{k}{\ell}{\rp^n}\big)\geq \tfrac{\pi}{3}$. %for $k,\ell$ such that $k \leq \frac{n-1}{2}$ and $\binom{\ell}{k}$ is odd.
\end{itemize}

\begin{proof}
	Take arbitrary $m, k, \ell$ such that $1 \leq m \leq n$, $k \leq \frac{n-1}{2}$ and $\binom{\ell}{k}$ is odd.
    Let $\alpha = \crit(\rp^n)$, $\beta_m = 2\firstdeath{m}{\rp^n}$ and $\gamma_{\Sq_\ell^k}= 2\firstdeath{\theta}{\rp^n}$.
    We have shown in \cref{s:first_critical_value_rpn} that
	$$
	\alpha = \beta_m = \gamma_{\Sq_\ell^k} = \frac{2\pi}{3}.
	$$
	%for any $1 \leq m \leq n$, and $k$ and $\ell$ such that $k \leq \frac{n-1}{2}$ and $\binom{\ell}{k}$ is odd.

    (1) It is clear that %$\alpha= \tfrac{2\pi}{3}$ lies in $[\zeta_n, \pi)$ and
    $\beta_m = \tfrac{2\pi}{3}$ lies in $\big[\zeta_n, \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}+\zeta_m\big]$ satisfying the condition of Part (2) of the lemma in \cref{subsub:comparison_lemma}.
	Applying \cref{eq:db_usual_upper_bound} and \cref{subsub:comparison_lemma}, we obtain
	\[\db\big(\Hbarc{m}{\VS}, \Hbarc{m}{\rp^n}\big)
    \leq \max\{|\zeta_m  - \beta_m |, \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}\}
    = \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}.\]
    Since $m$ is taken arbitrarily, we obtain the desired inequality.

	(2) On the other hand, applying \cref{eq:db_theta_lower_bound}, we have
	\[\db\big(\sqbarcl{k}{\ell}{\VS}, \sqbarcl{k}{\ell}{\rp^n}\big)
	\geq \min\{\tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_{\Sq_\ell^k}, \zeta_n\}
	= \min\{\tfrac{1}{2}\cdot\tfrac{2\pi}{3}, \zeta_n\}
	= \tfrac{\pi}{3}.%\qedhere
    \]
    Since $k$ and $\ell$ are taken arbitrarily, we obtain the desired inequality.
\end{proof}

Since \(\tfrac{\pi}{3} < \tfrac{\pi - \zeta_n}{2}\), with the difference larger than \(\tfrac{\pi}{12}\), the theorem above demonstrates that Steenrod barcodes provide a better lower bound estimate of the Gromov--Hausdorff distance than the persistent homology barcodes do in all degrees.
