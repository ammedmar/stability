\subsection{Spheres and their wedge sum}\label{ss:Sn}\label{sub:Sn and wedge sum}

For any integer $n \geq 1$ and real number $\rho > 0$, let $\bS^n(\rho)$ be the \defn{$n$-sphere of radius $\rho$}
\[
\bS^n(\rho) = \set{x \in \R^n : \bars{x} = \rho}.
\]
With the induced Riemannian metric, \(\bS^n(\rho)\) is referred to as a \defn{round sphere}.
We simplify notation writing \(\bS^n\) instead of \(\bS^n(1)\).
The constant
\[\zeta_n = \arccos\Big(\frac{-1}{n+1}\Big)\]
will play an important role.
It is the diameter of an inscribed regular $(n+1)$-simplex in $\bS^n$.

\subsubsection{}\label{subsub:critical values of Sn}

\medskip\lemma
For any $m,n \in \N$ and linear cohomology operation $\theta$ we have:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \(\crit(\bS^n) = \frac{1}{2}\zeta_n\),
	\item \(\firstdeath{m}{\bS^n} =
	\begin{cases}
		\frac{1}{2}\zeta_n & m = n, \\
		\hfil 0 & m \neq n,
	\end{cases}\)
	\item \(\firstdeath{\theta}{\bS^n} = 0\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
	(1) Recall from \cite[Thm.~7.1]{lim2024vietoris} that for any $0 < r \leq \zeta_n$, the space $\VR_r(\bS^n)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\bS^n$, and the homotopy type of $\VR_r(\bS^n)$ changes at $\zeta_n$.
%	\footnote{
%		The case $n = 1$ has more information.
%		From \cite[Thm.~7.4]{adamaszek2017vietoris} it is known that $\VR_r(\bS^1)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\bS^{2n+1}$ for any $n \in \N$ and $\frac{2n\pi}{2n+1} < r \leq \frac{2(n+1)\pi}{2n+3}$.
%		For $d=1$ and $n > 1$ and one also has more information.
%		Recall that a metric space $(\cX, d)$ is said to be a \defn{geodesic space} if for each $x, y \in \cX$ there exists geodesic from $x$ to $y$ of length $d(x, y)$.
%		As stated in \cite[Prop.~7.10]{virk20201} one knows that if $\cX$ be a simply-connected geodesic space, then $\barc\rH_1(\cX) = \emptyset$.
%		Since the spheres we are considering are geodesic their $\rH_1$ barcode is empty.}
	This implies $\crit(\bS^n)=\frac{1}{2}\zeta_n$.

	\smallskip (2) According to \cite{katz1983filling}, \(\fillrad(\bS^n) = \frac{1}{2}\zeta_n\).
	Applying \cref{ss:beta v.s. fillrad}, we obtain \(\firstdeath{n}{\bS^n} = \frac{1}{2}\zeta_n\).
    When $m\neq n$, the statement follows from the fact that the initial space in the filtration has a trivial degree $m$ reduced homology.

	\smallskip (3) We apply a similar argument as in the $m\neq n$ case of (2). The statement follows from the fact that the initial space in the filtration has trivial $\img_\theta$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{}\label{ss:VRSn projection}

Let \(n \in \N\) and \(r \in (0, \zeta_n]\).
From the previous proposition we know that the spaces \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\) and \(\bS^n\) have the same homotopy type for any \(n \in \N\).
We now recall from \cite{adamaszek2020homotopy} a natural map realizing this equivalence.

We recall the \defn{canonical projection of \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\)}, the map
\[
f_r^n \colon \VR_r(\bS^n) \to \R^{n+1} \setminus \set{0} \to \bS^n
\]
defined as the composition of the map sending a formal linear combination $\sum\lambda_i x_i$ to the point \(\sum\lambda_i x_i\) in \(\bbR^{n+1}\) and the map sending a point in \(\R^{n+1} \setminus \set{0}\) to its radial projection.
Here and for the remainder of this work, we do not distinguish between a simplicial complex and its geometric realization.

The well-definedness of $f_r^n$ follows from a similar argument to that in \cite[Lemma 3]{lovasz1983self}.\anibal{no URL or DOI given. Was this obtained from mathscinet?}
While the original proof was carried out for Euclidean spheres, an analogous argument applies to geodesic spheres.\anibal{a bit confusing. I think it is good to reference back the place where this well-definedness is stated in the original paper introducing the canonical projection.}

\medskip\lemma
The canonical projection of \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\) is a homotopy equivalence for every $r \in (0, \zeta_n]$.

\begin{proof}
    In \cite{adamaszek2018metric}, a new topology was introduced on the Vietoris--Rips complex, with which the authors proved that the canonical projection of \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\) is a homotopy equivalence.
    More recently, \cite{gillespie2024vietoris} showed that the identity map is a weak equivalence between this new topology and the usual one.
    Consequently, the canonical projection of \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\) is a weak equivalence for the usual Vietoris--Rips complex.
    By the Whitehead theorem, this weak equivalence between CW spaces is indeed a homotopy equivalence.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{}\label{subsub:barcode_Sn}

We apply \cref{subsub:critical values of Sn} and the barcode estimates from \cref{ss:barcode_general} to \(\bS^n\).
Using the facts that (1) the reduced homology of \(\bS^n\) has dimension one for \(m = n\) and is zero for all other values of \(m\), and (2) for any linear cohomology operation \(\theta \in \cO(\ell, m)\) with \(\ell \neq m\), \(\img \theta_{\bS^n}\) is trivial, we proceed with the estimation but omit the figure, as it is simply a special case of \cref{fig:barcodes_vs}.

\subsubsection{}\label{ss:barcodes_VS}

For $n \in \N$ and $u_1, \dots, u_n \in \N^n$, let
\[
\VS^{u_1,\dots,u_n} =
\overbrace{\bS^1\vee\dots\vee\bS^1}^{u_1} \vee\dots\vee \overbrace{\bS^n\vee\dots\vee\bS^n}^{u_n}.
\]
Using the homotopy equivalence between the Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric gluing with the wedge sum of the Vietoris--Rips complex described in \cref{ss:wedge sum}, we have the following isomorphisms of persistence modules for \(\degp \in \N\) and \(\theta \in \cO(\ell,\degp)\):
\[
\begin{split}
	\rH_\degp^\VR(\VS^{u_1,\dots,u_n}) &\cong \, \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \rH_\degp^\VR(\bS^i)^{\oplus u_i}, \\
	\img_\theta^\VR(\VS^{u_1,\dots,u_n}) &\cong \, \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \img_\theta^\VR(\bS^i)^{\oplus u_i}.
\end{split}
\]

Therefore, both the homology barcodes and \(\img_\theta\)-barcodes of \(\VR(\VS^{u_1, \dots, u_n})\) are the multiset unions of the corresponding barcodes of \(\bS^{u_i}\); see \cref{fig:barcodes_vs}.
