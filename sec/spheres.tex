\subsection{Spheres}\label{ss:Sn}\label{subsub:critical values of Sn}

For any integer $n \geq 1$ and real number $r > 0$, let $\bS^n(r)$ be the \defn{$n$-sphere} of radius $r$ centered at the origin of $\R^{n+1}$.
We consider it equipped with the geodesic distance.
We simplify notation writing \(\bS^n\) instead of \(\bS^n(1)\).

%We apply the notations and results from \cref{sub:general_barcodes} to the Vietoris--Rips complexes of $\bS^n$ with $R = \pi$ the diameter of the sphere.
%Let \(\degp \in \N\) and \(\theta \in \cO(\ell,\degp)\) a linear cohomology operation with \(\ell \neq \degp\).

\medskip\proposition
Let $\alpha, \beta_\degp$ and $\gamma_\theta$ be respectively the first critical values of $\VR\bS^n$, its $\degp^{\th}$ reduced homology, and its $\img_\theta$-module for \(\theta \in \cO(\ell,\degp)\) with \(\ell \neq \degp\).
Then:
\[
\mathrm{(1)}\ \alpha = \zeta_n,
\qquad
\mathrm{(2)}\ \beta_m =
\begin{cases}
	\zeta_n & m = n, \\
	\hfil 0 & m \neq n,
\end{cases}
\qquad
\mathrm{(3)}\ \gamma_\theta = 0,
\]
where \(\zeta_n \defeq \arccos(\tfrac{-1}{n+1})\).\anibal{I think reduced homology is better to consider in this whole section, no?}

\begin{proof}
	(1) Recall from \cite[Thm.~7.1]{lim2020vietoris} that for any $0 < r \leq \zeta_n$, the space $\VR_r(\bS^n)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\bS^n$, and the homotopy type of $\VR_r(\bS^n)$ changes at $\zeta_n$.\footnote{
		The case $n = 1$ has more information.
		From \cite[Thm.~7.4]{adamaszek2017vietoris} it is known that $\VR_r(\bS^1)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\bS^{2n+1}$ for any $n \in \N$ and $\frac{2n\pi}{2n+1} < r \leq \frac{2(n+1)\pi}{2n+3}$.
		For $d=1$ and $n > 1$ and one also has more information.
		Recall that a metric space $(\cX, d)$ is said to be a \defn{geodesic space} if for each $x, y \in \cX$ there exists geodesic from $x$ to $y$ of length $d(x, y)$.
		As stated in \cite[Prop.~7.10]{virk20201} one knows that if $\cX$ be a simply-connected geodesic space, then $\barc\rH_1(\cX) = \emptyset$.
		Since the spheres we are considering are geodesic their $\rH_1$ barcode is empty.}
	This implies $\alpha=\zeta_n$.

	(2) According to \cite{katz1983filling}, \(\mathrm{FillRad}(\bS^n) = \frac{1}{2}\zeta_n\).
	From \cref{ss:filling_radius}, it follows that \((0, \zeta_n)\) is a bar in the \(n^{\text{th}}\) reduced homology of \(\VR (\bS^n)\).
	Thus, \(\beta_n \leq \zeta_n\).
	On the other hand, since \(\beta_n \geq \alpha = \zeta_n\), we conclude that \(\beta_n = \zeta_n\).\anibal{missing the \(\degp \neq n\)} case.

	(3) The remaining parts of the proposition follow from the fact that the initial space in the filtration has trivial $\degp^{\th}$ homology for $1\leq \degp \neq n$ and trivial $\theta$ cohomology operations for any \(\theta \in \cO(\ell,\degp)\) with \(\ell \neq \degp\).\anibal{I did not touch this proof. The statement us already strange. \(\gamma_\theta = 0\) means that at \((0,0)\) appears in the barcode. Is that what you mean?}
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{}

For any \(m \geq 1\), \(\dim \opH_\degp(\bS^n)\) is one for \(\degp = n\) and zero otherwise.
For any \(\theta \in \cO(\ell, m)\) with \(\ell \neq m\), \(\theta_{\bS^n}\) is trivial.
Applying these facts, along with the above proposition, to the results in \cref{sub:general_barcodes}, we obtain barcode estimates for \(\bS^n\).\anibal{I think this SS is redundant if the general estimates are well written.}

% Similarly, for any linear cohomology operation $\theta \in \cO(\ell,m)$ with $\ell \neq m$, every bar in the barcode of $\img\theta_{\VR\bS^n}$ or $\ker\theta_{\VR\bS^n}$ is dominated by $(\zeta_n,\pi)$.

\subsection{Wedge sum of spheres}

%\subsubsection{}

For $n \in \N$ and $\ell_1, \dots, \ell_n \in \N^n$, let
\[
\VS^{\ell_1,\dots,\ell_n} =
\overbrace{\bS^1\vee\dots\vee\bS^1}^{\ell_1} \vee\dots\vee \overbrace{\bS^n\vee\dots\vee\bS^n}^{\ell_n}.
%(\bS^1)^{\vee m_1} \vee \dots \vee (\bS^n)^{\vee m_n}.
\]
Using the homotopy equivalence between the Vietoris--Rips filtration of a metric gluing with the wedge sum of the Vietoris--Rips filtration described in \cref{ss:wedge sum}, we have the following isomorphisms of persistence modules for \(\degp \in \N\) and \(\theta \in \cO(\ell,\degp)\):
\[
\begin{split}
	\rH_\degp (\VR\VS^{\ell_1,\dots,\ell_n}) &\cong \, \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \rH_\degp (\VR\bS^i)^{\oplus \ell_i}, \\
	\img_\theta \VR(\VS^{\ell_1,\dots,\ell_n}) &\cong \, \bigoplus_{i=1}^n (\img_\theta \VR\bS^i)^{\oplus \ell_i}.
\end{split}
\]

Therefore, both the homology barcodes and \(\img_\theta\)-barcodes of \(\VS^{\ell_1, \dots, \ell_n}\) can be obtained by taking appropriate unions of the corresponding barcodes of \(\bS^1, \dots, \bS^n\).
To facilitate the bottleneck distance estimates in later sections, we illustrate the barcode estimates for the wedge sum of spheres in \cref{fig:barcodes_vs}.\anibal{More needs to be said in words. What does ``appropriate unions'' means? I also think the monotonicity of \(\zeta_n\) wrt \(n\) is important, no?}

% $\rH_\degp(\VS^{\ell_1,\dots,\ell_n})$ contains $\ell_\degp$ copies of $(0,\zeta_\degp)$.
% All remaining bars in this barcode must be dominated by $(\zeta_n, \pi)$.
% This holds for all degrees, with the convention that $\ell_\degp = 0$ for $\degp > n$.

% Similarly, for any linear cohomology operation $\theta \in \cO(\ell,m)$ with $\ell \neq m$, every bar in either its $\img\theta$ or $\ker\theta$ barcode is dominated by $(\zeta_n, \pi)$.
